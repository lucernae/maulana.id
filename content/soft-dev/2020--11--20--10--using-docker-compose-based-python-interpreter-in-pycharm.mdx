# Intro

I was involved with different kinds of Django project in the past. Back then the standard approach of attaching your debug interpreter is by creating a virtual environment in your python project. We debug using PyCharm at that time. JetBrains has generously gave us free open source license to use the whole suite of JetBrains tools.

However, back then the notion of developing a Django project from inside a container is not so common. We already manage some of our projects as microservices described by a (or several) docker-compose file. To debug with this kind of setup, we are using SSH daemon inside our container. Then we setup PyCharm so that it treats the docker container as a **remote interpreter**. This is working for quite a long time (almost 5 years). Then finally JetBrains released some supports to allow interpreters inside a docker-compose configuration.

Things didn't transition smoothly back then. First issue that I remember is that the interpreter forgets all of the environment variables declared in the docker-compose file. Since Django used environment variable to override it's settings file, this setup were unusable. So we keep doing the old ways, using remote interpreter.

Recent PyCharm version is making it more difficult to set up a remote interpreter. As of now, in version 2020.2, when we set up a remote interpreter, PyCharm implicitly defined deployment configuration. This is not needed if you are using a container, because the files were already mounted there, you don't need to copy it again using sftp, etc. However the new interface is quite confusing because you can't disable the setting at first. You are only allowed to delete the deployment configuration after you've made the configuration (funny, eh?). I've also tried different approach, such as creating the SSH configuration first, then set it as remote interpreter, but still it generate the deployment configuration.

So, fed up with this, I decided to try the docker-compose-based interpreter again. I noticed several improvements:

1. You can now include multiple docker-compose recipes (useful for overriding local config on top of production config)
2. You are allowed to include an environment file (they fixed the main deal breaker from previous issue)
3. You can map local directory with the directory inside container (so that PyCharm knew it was the same thing)
4. When you create a Run Configuration, the environment the interpreter use is the one coming from docker-compose. So, you won't need to redeclare your environment variables again. Hurray!

# Requirements

This articles are going to be some sort of hands on labs/workshop. You can skim thru, but it is best if you do it at your own pace.

We are going to assume this basic understanding of technical skills:

1. Git and how to use it to clone project from Github
2. Docker, Docker-compose, and how to use their CLI
3. Linux based environment, or MacOS, or WSL.
4. Python and Django basic understanding
5. Debugging methods/terminologies

In addition to that, since we are using PyCharm, you need PyCharm Pro Edition to use it's debugging features.

# Usual setup without IDE

In order to demonstrate how PyCharm enhance our development workflow -- and not ruining it or conflicting with the current workflow --. I create a small sample repo here so you can see our basic [Django setup](https://github.com/lucernae/django-ide-setup). My explanations will refer to that repo. Clone the repo to start experimenting on it.

We are going to setup a small microservice based django server. The repo contains two folder `django_project` and `deployment`. The `deployment` folder contains orchestration script to run the project. The `django_project` is where the actual Django app is located.

To run the project, we (by we, I mean my colleague and myself) usually go into the deployment folder and run `make` scripts to spin up the server. We don't have those now since we want to be a bit more technical and dive in. We are going to run docker-compose directly.

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This is just to warm up docker. We want to build our initial images and see it running. One of good rule of thumbs to help you later setup production build: Prepare one initial docker-compose that can be run immediately without having to do further customization so developers can easily check the code out.

If you open your browser and navigate to http://localhost/ . You will see the default welcome screen. It will only says `Welcome in localhost`.

Since using an IDE is a choice, I want to believe that running the project immediately should not depend heavily on the choice of IDE. The developer should be able to run this out of the box. 

However, this is a minimal setup. When doing some custom development works, or deployment, you will have to change some deployment configuration. To illustrate this, I've prepared a simple template `.template.env` and `docker-compose.override.template.yml`.

But before we proceed, shutdown the current stack first, since we are going to change the compose config.

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Copy the file `.template.env` as just `.env`. This is docker compose environment config file. When interpolating variables in the docker-compose files, generally the precedence will be:

default value --> env file --> shell environment variables

This means if a variable are defined in the env file but not in the shell, then docker-compose will use whatever value defined in the env file. This is very flexible and support declarative deployment. For example, in the previous docker-compose command, if you look at the basic recipe `docker-compose.yml` You will see that we have defined environment variable inside django container to take value from the shell with some default value:

```yaml
services:
  django:
    environment:
      DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: mysite.settings
      DEBUG: ${DEBUG:-False}
      SITENAME: ${SITENAME:-localhost}
```

With this kind of variable passing, we can expect that the environment variables are accessible from within Django settings so we can make a fully config based deployment.

Now look at the `.env` file you just copied.

```ini
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=mysite
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml

DEBUG=True
SITENAME=myothersite.test

DJANGO_HTTP_PORT=8080
HTTP_PORT=80
```

We override some settings. Notably `DEBUG` variable to become `True` because we want to enable Django debug mode. You can experiment by changing other variables too. For the top two variables: `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` and `COMPOSE_FILE` were docker-compose internal variables. Changing `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` will change your docker-compose stack namespace (useful to quickly associate which stack with which project). Meanwhile, `COMPOSE_FILE` can control which docker-compose file are going to be included by `docker-compose` command.

We are going to create an extra compose file to override some deployment config. Change value into `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.override.yml`. A useful note worth knowing, if you omit `COMPOSE_FILE` variable entirely (make it empty value), then `docker-compose` default behaviour is to look for `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml` if it exists. By the way, the precedence matter. Rightmost file mentioned in the variable will override files on the left.

Now, create `docker-compose.override.yml` from the template `docker-compose.override.template.yml`.

You can see the content like this:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  django:
    command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080
    volumes:
    - ../django_project:/home/web/django_project

  nginx:
    volumes:
    - ./sites-enabled:/etc/nginx/conf.d
```

Since we are going to be in 'development mode', we use django manage.py server. We also mount our local directory so the container will always have latest changes in our files. We also mount nginx config in case we are dealing with production mode settings. You can even add more overrides like `environments` or `ports` depending on the need.

Now that we're ready, spin up the stack (without rebuilding)

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You can then check again http://localhost:8080/ . Now it says `Welcome in myothersite.test`, which is the value of `SITENAME` that we declared in the `.env` file. It will also spawn a Django debug server in port 8080 by default. We setup two server like this because Django debug server supports hot reload. So if you change codes or templates, you may want to see the changes immediately. In that case, you can navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to see the changes.

This is as far as our native setup goes without IDE. Basically you do the development in the files in your host machine, but the python and Django server were deployed using container.

One other thing worth mention is how we run unittest. Since Django and Python is in a container, we run Django tests like this:

```bash
docker-compose exec django python manage.py test
```

As you can see, the command becomes very long. That's why we store `Makefile` to provide a shortcut command in the deployment directory.

Before continuing the next section, don't forget to shut down the stack

```bash
docker-compose down
```

# IDE Setup Using PyCharm

To see how much PyCharm improve our workflow, using the same repo, open the folder in PyCharm.

PyCharm bundled the docker-compose plugin integration by default. If for some reason you can't use it, refer to [official doc][1].

Open the `docker-compose.yml` file in the `deployment` directory. You will see that the lines are annotated by arrows like this:

![docker-compose.yml file](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2020-11-22-at-18.51.14.png "docker-compose.yml file")

You can click the arrow. Click the double arrow in the `services:` line. PyCharm will deploy that recipe for you. The service tab will appear to let you know that the compose file are deployed.

![](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2020-11-22-at-18.57.02.png)

As you can see, it also pick up the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` that you specify in `.env` file. `mysite` is the name of the stack and you can drill it down to see the services. This tab offer some controls too. You can redeploy, stop, or down the deployment with just a click. Right click the deployment name to see the context menu.

After some sightseeing you will notice that what you deploy (even though it picks up `.env` file) is only the recipe from `docker-compose.yml` file. It is evident if you see the service log of django, it shows uWSGI running and not Django debug server.

![](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2020-11-22-at-19.02.44.png)

So, edit the PyCharm configuration. You can do it from the deployment context menu then Edit Configuration, or deployment configuration bar on the top menu. Basically add the file `docker-compose.override.yml` in the Compose files field. So you will have something like this:

![](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2020-11-22-at-19.06.45.png)

Now you can spin up/down your deployment stack with just a button click from your Services tab. By clicking deploy, you can update your stack deployment and recreate a fresh service. It is now running using Django Debug Server.

It's quite convenient now to edit your docker-compose file and apply the changes to the deployment.

In a typical development session, you mostly run the deployment once, do some coding, and then validate it and maybe do some debugging. So we are going to set up that workflow too.

We first setup the Python Interpreter.

Open PyCharm Project settings, then navigate to Project Interpreter. Click the gear icon and click Add. You will be given several options to select the source of your interpreter. Choose docker-compose. Fill in the settings, which consists of Configuration file(s) (Put `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.override.yml` in that order), and the service (Pick `django`). It should looks like in the image below. Click OK.

![](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2020-11-22-at-19.15.30.png)

It might take some times for PyCharm to build it's custom images (with pycharm helpers inside the containers).

Next, you want to set project path mappings. The location of codes in your repo in your host computer are different with the locations **inside** the container. That's why PyCharm needs to know it. Specify this project path mappings. In our case we map `django_project` into `/home/web/django_project` inside the container. This is as reflected in the volume declarations of our `docker-compose.override.yml`. In your own project, you need decide by yourself what are the paths that needed to be mapped out, because it can be more than one.

Screenshot below can be used as visual guide:

![](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2020-11-22-at-19.19.28.png)

Once you are done, click OK. Wait a bit for PyCharm to build the helper skeletons. Once it's finish rebuilding, you can click **Python Console** tab to load the python console in PyCharm. This is the same Python interpreter that Django will use. You can also check that the variables from `.env` file carried over nicely as seen in the screenshots:

![](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2020-11-22-at-19.27.32.png)

Note that this is a Python interpreter, not Django shell. To use Django, you need to enable Django integration.

Open Project Settings again, type **Django** in the search bar**.** In the **Language and Frameworks** menu, select Django. Enable Django Support. Fill in all relevant information for your project. In our example, the Django project root is in `django_project` directory, and the settings module is in `mysite.settings`. See screenshot below for reference:

![](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2020-11-22-at-19.33.05.png)

After setting this up, whenever you navigate to the **Python Console**, you will get **Django Console** instead:

![](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2020-11-22-at-19.36.22.png)

It's the same thing you get from running `docker-compose exec django python manage.py shell`. Isn't that sweet? As you can see, the settings file and environment variables from `.env` are properly loaded and evaluated as Django settings.

Now, let's step up further and create a Django server run configuration.

Mark `django_project` directory as a **Source Directory** by right clicking the directory and select **Mark Directory as** >  **Sources Root** . If it's not detected already, mark the `django_project/mysite/templates` directory as **Templates Folder**. You will now be able to activate code completions in that folder.

To create a new Run/Debug Config (for Django now), click the Configuration selector, or navigate from menu **Run** > **Edit Configuration**. As you can see, you already have docker-compose run configuration. We now want to add Django run config. Click the + button and choose **Django Server**. Most of our config resides in `.env` file. So we don't actually need to modify anything else here besides the target server address to match the port that we expose to in the container (currently 8080). See the screenshot for reference:

![](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2020-11-22-at-19.48.18.png)

Click OK. Then you can click the Run Button with **Django** config selected (or whatever the name you gave for the config in previous step). Run button will run the Django Debug Server as usual, meanwhile Debug button will attach PyCharm debugger to Django. Let's check what Debug button do.

Debug mode panel will show up after you click Debug button. It basically recreates service to attach debugger. You can also see the log in that panel, which is nice because you don't need to go inside the container to see that now.

As with any debugging session, you can attach breakpoint to any of your python code in the sources folder. With PyCharm you can even attach breakpoint in the template! You can debug in realtime when the template is currently rendered. This is such an awesome features. Here's what it looks like when you are currently debugging Django Template:

![](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2020-11-22-at-20.05.03.png)

You can do many things in this mode, such as inspecting variables and so on. If for some reason this template debugger doesn't work for you, check out the [documentation][2] and make sure that you set the current template language to be Django instead of Jinja.
