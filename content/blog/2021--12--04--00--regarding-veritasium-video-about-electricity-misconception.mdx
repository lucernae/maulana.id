title: Regarding Veritasium video about electricity misconception
description: This is my own personal take on the video. While what he said is true, being EM waves is the energy carrier, but the initial question and answer is a bit misleading

Before we go further, please take a look at the original video and questions from Veritasium [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHIhgxav9LY).
He raises an initial question which I paraphrase here for convenience:

> Imagine you have a giant circuit, consisting of a battery, a switch, light bulb, and two wires spanning 300,000 km long.

(Note that, the comma in 300,000 is a thousand separator and not a decimal separator).

The circuit is drawn like this:

Important points to note at:

1. If you trace out the wires from the battery to the lightbulb, it will take around 150,000 km in the direction from the earth to the moon, then 150,000 km
   in the direction from the moon to earth to reach the lightbulb (a total of 300,000 km). Then you trace the other side the same way, a total of 300,000 km.
2. Immediate distance between the battery and the lightbulb is just 1 m.
3. It is using a battery, meaning it will be a DC circuit.
4. Assume that wire resistance is negligible. I know, this is a stretch, especially since the wire spans hundreds thousands km, but let's pretend resistance
   is negligible.

The question is, once we flip the switch (circuit connected), how much time it takes for the light bulb to turn on?

The available options:

1. 0.5s
2. 1s
3. 2s
4. $\frac{1}{c}$ s
5. None of the above

You can guess right now, but I just want to make clear about option 4. It is a little bit misleading for Veritasium to put it as $\frac{1}{c}$ s. If you give the second unit,
then you also need to say it 1 meter over c second. Because $c$ in this case is the speed of light constant, and it has unit m/s. 
I guess I'm just being nitpicky, but if we wrote it as 1 meter over $c$, then it is clear that it is calculated that way because 1 meter is the distance 
between the battery and the lightbulb.

Long story short, Veritasium said the answer is 4.

...Which is not surprising for me...

But the way he explains it is kind of misleading in my opinion since the circuit itself is DC.

Before we proceed even further, let me explain that I'm not a physicist nor an electrical engineer. I'm just a computer science bachelor graduate that also
took mandatory (basic) electrical engineering course. I could be wrong. But the spirit that I want to convey here is how we are going to try to find the truth.

# The difference between AC and DC

Quick recap: AC = Alternating Current, DC = Direct Current.

They are both describing current flows or electrical charge flows. The main difference is that in AC, the current is always changing direction and magnitude.
While in DC, it is always constant and one directional.

Both types of current follows Maxwell Equations and Poynting vector theory. However, DC is kind of special in our case here. When someone flips a switch in 
a closed DC circuit, the current doesn't behave immediately as DC. It only works as DC when the current is steady (constant). When the switch flips, the current 
change from zero to the steady DC value. The interval between 0 to this certain value must obey the same Maxwell laws, so it can't immediately jump. 
Which is why this interval is called a transient "event".
