# Balloon that floats...

My daughter recently got two helium balloon that floats, gifted. While she played with it, at some point, both balloons touched the ceiling at almost the same time. The balloons are attached to a light string so we can pull the balloon down again.

I don’t know exactly what gas they used to fill the balloon, but I’m guessing it’s Helium. Helium is a light noble gas, lighter than air. But, what does it mean by saying **lighter than air**? It is more accurate to say that Helium gas were less dense than air density in room temperature.

The concept of air density, is similar with fluid density or liquid density. You divide the mass with the volume that the mass occupies. However, gas can be compressed. So, normally if you compare air density, you declare that the pressure and temperature is the same between them.
