# Balloon that floats...

My daughter recently got two helium balloon that floats, it was gifted. While she played with it, at some point, both balloons touched the ceiling at almost the same time. The balloons are attached to a light string so we can pull the balloon down again.

I don’t know exactly what gas they used to fill the balloon, but I’m guessing it’s Helium. Helium is a light noble gas, lighter than air. But, what does it mean by saying **lighter than air**? It is more accurate to say that Helium gas were less dense than air density in room temperature.

The concept of air density, is similar with fluid density or liquid density. You divide the mass with the volume that the mass occupies. However, gas can be compressed. So, normally if you compare air density, you declare the the pressure and temperature between them.

To understand how balloon floats, we will talk a little bit about the physics behind it. Simply speaking, in the surface of the earth, any object will be affected by gravity. This includes air. Air contains groups of molecules. If they were located in the same gravitational potential, they will contain the same potential energy.                  These group of air will need to have a matching internal energy that is “bound” by the gravity. If their internal energy is higher, they will naturally floats higher, where the potential energy is higher than the surface (less gravity). By “migrating” into area which have higher potential energy, they converted their internal energy into potential energy.

In the case of air, since a volume of air is compressible. Sometimes we associate internal energy of volumes of air (macroscopic quanity) with it’s pressure. This is why we have the equation $PV=nRT$ where the right hand side basically contains information about the energy (albeit with some modification, depending on the gas). Back with the balloon, we can say, denser/heavier air will try to settle down because it was affected by gravity. This will cause the denser air below to push (by the pressure difference) lesser dense air to float, until it settles in their preferred height.

The *somewhat* invisible force that moved the balloon up is most commonly called **Buoyant** force. People also called it **Archimedes Principle** in honoring Archimedes, the greek philosopher that rediscover this principles. The buoyant force is defined like this:

$
F_b=\rho g V
$

Where: $\rho$ is the density of the surrounding fluid, $V$ is the displaced volumes and $g$ is the average gravity in that position.

Naturally, we usually think that air density is different by height from the surface of the earth, due to gravitational potential I described earlier. To simplify things, we limit ourselves to only observe floating balloon in uniform air density, such as inside a room. We are talking about my daughter’s balloon here, not atmospheric balloon. :p

# Slow free-floating balloon in a room

Let’s observe a simple case of free-floating balloon in a room. We identify there exists macroscopic force, i.e: buoyant force $F_b$ and gravitational force $W$. We are going to ignore drag force by saying that the balloon is slow moving (making the drag force negligible). Since usually the weight of the rubber balloon and the weight of the air inside is not significantly different, we can’t ignore the rubber weight, so we include it in the equation as $W_r$, meanwhile the weight of the air inside the balloon is called $W_b$. Check out my ugly force diagram for clarity.

Using Newton’s Second Law:

$
\sum \boldsymbol{F} = m \boldsymbol{a} \
F_b — W_r - W_b = ma \
\rho g V - m_r g - \rho_b g V = \rho_b V a \
a = g (\frac{\rho}{\rho_b} - \frac{m_r}{\rho_b V} - 1)
$

The equation above uses these implicit assumptions:

* Balloon’s shape was not going to be deformed and stable
* No turbulent
* Balloon strictly only floats in y direction
* Air pressure and density inside the room is uniform and constant
* Drag force is ignored because the balloon travels slowly and relatively negligible compared with the other force

If we observe the final equation, it turns out that the acceleration is constant! We predict that the velocity will increase to infinity, but of course that is incorrect because in the real situation, the air density will decrease in high-altitude. Moreover, when the drag force becomes significant, the velocity will be limited into a terminal velocity. However, in our case with short distance inside a room (from the floor to the ceiling) this will suffice.

We can make some fun conclusions from this equation alone. In the second term, $\frac{m_r}{\rho_b V}$ we are going to see how big the value is. Let’s try with Helium, [at STP](https://physics.info/density/) (standard temperature & pressure) it has $\rho_b=0.164 kg/m^3$. I can’t measure the flat balloon‘s mass, because it’s too small. But to be safe, let’s say it is 1.5 g (between 1 and 2), which is equal to $m_r=0.0015 kg$. A typical balloon can have the shape of the sphere (again, simple assumptions) with radius of 10 cm. So it would be around $V=0.004 m^3$ in volume. In summary, the term will be around 2.3 ratio. Combined with the third term, the first term will be subtracted by 3.3.

Now let’s estimate the first term. Standard air density [at STP](https://physics.info/density/) is around $\rho=1.161$. The first term will be around 7.08 in value. So the final upward acceleration is about 3.62 times the gravitational acceleration. This is quite surprising to me because the rate that the balloon floats is actually much faster than the rate of people falling by more than 3 times.

You would think that this is very fishy. If you drop a ball and let balloon afloats, even if the direction is the opposite, you can clearly tell that obviously the object falling is much faster than balloon floats. So, our estimate is only valid for a very-very short distance but not yet accurate for room height.

There is also another possibility. It could be that a typical Helium party balloon is not purely composed by Helium. It might be a mix of Helium and regular air. Who knows...

Anyway, it’s also interesting to note, the above formula for $a$ also valid for any mix of air inside a balloon. That means, if you put regular air inside the balloon, the acceleration will be negative and the balloon falls down. If you assume that the density inside and outside the balloon is the same, first term and third term will cancel out. Then the second term is decidingly negative.

However, if you put normal air inside a balloon, it tends to be denser because the rubber will slightly compress the air inside the balloon causing more air is trapped inside the balloon with the same pressure. Thus even the balloon’
s content will be heavier than the surrounding air and falls down.

To compare it, imagine if you fill the balloon with water completely, and then put inside a pool. The balloon will floats below the surface, but doesn’t touch the ground. This is because water’s pressure is significantly stronger and water is less compressible than air, so you can’t pack more water inside a balloon denser than the surrounding water.

# Balloon that floats with attached strings...

The previous case seems to be very generic and apply to most generic situations.

My daughter’s balloon, is a little bit special. It has strings/threads attached in it. I observed this balloon day by day. At the first day, we let it touch the ceiling. Then at some point it actually stays midair with part of the strings resting in the floor, even if it was not anchored. Kind of like standing balloon.

Of course, I suspect that the air inside the balloon has partly escaped. But I was more interested in understanding why it floats without anchored. I suspect because the strings can behave as a variable mass.

Since now the balloon is definitely not a pure Helium. We can’t estimate it with numbers easily. But we can predict and models it’s behaviour or dynamics, then kind of match it with the equation.

We are going to use the same set of assumptions as before. But now, we add another weight force with regards to the string. I call it ”variable mass” because the amount of weight force it caused is dependent on how long the strings is currently stretched. If we use starting position in the floor, the whole strings are rested in the floor. It’s weights are canceled by the normal force. When it began to float, part of the strings with length $y$ (equal to the height of the balloon), will contribute to the balloon’s mass. Check out my ugly diagram again for clarity.

Basically, one extra thing to worry about is the weight of the threads. Since only hanging threads contribute to the weight, and it was based on the height, we define the length density of strings to be $\sigma$. The weight of the strings becomes $W_s=\sigma g y$.

Same Newton’s equation, we now amend it to become:

$
\sum \boldsymbol{F} = m \boldsymbol{a} \\
F_b — W_r - W_s - W_b = ma \\
\rho g V - m_r g - \sigma g y - \rho_b g V = \rho_b V a \\
a = g (\frac{\rho}{\rho_b} - \frac{m_r}{\rho_b V} - \frac{\sigma y}{\rho_b V} - 1)
$

As we can see now, the acceleration is not constant anymore, but it depends on the height of the balloon from the ground, $y$. This will make the equation above to be a differential equation. To make things compact, let’s rewrite $a=\ddot y$

$
a = g (\frac{\rho}{\rho_b} - \frac{m_r}{\rho_b V} - \frac{\sigma y}{\rho_b V} - 1) \\ 
$
