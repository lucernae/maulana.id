The very first experience I have with "Entropy" concept is coming from a chemistry class in high school. At that time, I was told that entropy is a measure of randomness and/or chaos within a thermodynamical system. This is overly simplified as you might already know. The "real" definition of entropy is divided into based on microscopic and macroscopic relations. The term entropy, for a physical meaning is a measure of how microscopic arrangement of energy can emerge to become macroscopic quantity. It is a brilliant significant landmark of classical + statistical physics.

The formula of physical entropy can be written as:

$$
S = k \ln(W)
$$
