I‘m stuck with constant headache this past two days. It made me unable to sleep soundly, and doing various fun activities. I was supposed to be on holiday. I took 2 weeks paid leave, off work, during this Ied Al-Fitr, Muslim’s big holiday. I want to play games, doing some side projects, learning new things. But instead all of that, I feel so wasted. I can’t look at the screen too long, either for reading, watching movies, or playing games. But sleeping also doesn’t get me better. If I sleep, I feel like wasting too much time.

From there, I began to overthink a lot. I feel like I’m just wasting time, all over again. I reflect to all various events happening at least since this start of Ramadhan. This Covid situation made it worst. Last year, I’m still living in Bandung. I have a friendly neighbourhood. The mosque’s committee (where we can pray) can arrange good praying schedule and procedures that is compliant with ”covid protocol”. After Ied Al-Fitr, I moved away to a different city. In this city, from my perspectives, things looks grim.

# Ramadhan in my memories

Last year, I thought this year’s Ramadhan is going to get better. It is not. I always thought that it will not bother me too much. I was wrong. It definitely affects my morale. I began comparing this year’s Ramadhan experience with what I had years ago. I know this is not good. But I can’t help it.

When I was a child, I lived about 2 or 3 km from the subdistrict Mosque. If I went there for Tarawih, I will be able to meet my friends and enjoy the rests of the night exploring the subdistrict square in front of it after praying. What makes it so special was because I’m not always able to go there. My father had to take me there (since it has to be after sun set) by motorbike. Then I had to go home with him. It’s like a special occasion. We can’t always do this because there’s also a small mosque near my house, and my father had to pray there.

There’s also an interesting story. When I was about 11 y.o, my friend invited me to see this big madrasah (like a big boarding school) called Al-Zaytun. I knew it was on a different subdistrict, so I asked him, “How do we get there?”. Because I know there’s no public transports. He said, “By bicycle of course. It’s close. I’ve done this before.” Ok, I believed him. But one thing I miscalculate was, it was currently Ramadhan month, so we were fasting.

So, with my friend, we rode our bicycle together. Thirty minutes, one hour, one hour and half past, I only drove straight, in the middle of noon. Still no big madrasah observed. I asked him,

”Damn, how many hours more we have to pedal until we get there?”

”Ah, maybe around one hour?”

Ugh, I feel so exhausted and thirsty, but we were fasting so we can’t drink. I feel like I’m going to collapse. More over, we’re just halfway there. Around 30 minutes after that, we passed the subdistrict’s border. Al-Zaytun is around the middle. There is a little joke famously known there that after passing the subdistrict border, there will be 2 different road. The left path is like a “red light district” of this sub district (you know what I mean), then the right path is the path to this religious school (Al-Zaytun). We took the right path, of course. We drove around 1 more hour. Finally we reached the gate.

”Okay, how do we get in?” I asked.

”What do you mean? you can’t get in.”

”Whaaat? You invite me to go here driving 4 hours only to stare at the gate?????”

”Well yeah…”

Ugh, now that I think back. That must be because he really wanted to study there. If we fast forward to my college years, I found that one of my college friend is from that school Al-Zaytun, so I asked if he knew about my childhood friend. Surprisingly, he went to that school. Good things for him.

But, anyway, for me, it’s the most exhausting experience I’ve ever had in elementary school. Don’t forget that I had to ride my bicycle 4 hours again to go back to my house. I spent 8 hours doing nothing but physical pain. There are no phones at that time, so I can’t contact my father and ask for help. But fortunately, with that experience, I’m confident that there’s nothing more exhausting than riding a bicycle for 8 hours (around 35 km back and forth). So, I’m quite proud with my stamina. 

Psychologically, there’s something changed in me that day. When we were halfway there, I almost gave up. I’m unbelievably thirtsy. We rests at nearby mosque. I was weighing some options. It’s too far to go back (we rode 2 hours). But if we push further, the way back is going to be more painful (I don’t know yet how long it took to get there). I’m to prideful to break my fast. I’d rather collapsed in the street than drink. So, instead of drinking, I pushed along, only believing that I can do it, for some unknown goal. I’m just hoping that the end goal will be worth it.

But it’s not.

Honestly it is not.

I arrived there with sheer willpower, but when I got there, it’s just a barren patch of lands, with big gate, and we can’t go inside. What a complete waste of time and effort.

Now think that I have to ride back home for 4 hours with that kind of feeling. In the house, I just lay there looking at the ceiling, waiting for Maghrib to come, so that I can break the fast.

Philosophically, let’s think about this. I took a journey with my friend. He convinced me that the goal is worth it (it is for him). I took the journey. I made it halfway. Halfway there, I weigh my options and I completely knew that ”I burned my bridge to go home”. So I keep going. But I was dissapointed with the goal. I went back home. The event feel completely useless, but the journey isn’t. It made me believe that I’m actually stronger than what I think. It turns out, what’s meaningful for me is the journey I made along the way, not the destination. I didn’t break a fast in that trip, even though it’s exhausting. 

It gave me confidence that sometimes in life, there will be times like this. You are doing something that is not totally worth it. But the trip teaches you something, only if you give it meaning according to what you believe in. What I believe in myself at that time is, ”I can do this without breaking a fast”. So even though the goal is disappointing, as long as you uphold your own rules, your journey is still meaningful at the end.

This trip surely changes how my mindset goes when I grew up.

# Ramadhan is the friend we made a long the way

I have a very different experience in high school. At some point in the second year of my high school, my friends and I planned some trip in Ramadhan. When in Ramadhan month, some people pray at different mosque each day throughout the month. This is because sometimes each mosque had a different way of celebrating Ramadhan (and of course the snacks, yummy). So, it is like a month full of festival if you pray at different mosque everyday. My friends and I want to raise the level a little bit. We want to go to each of our own houses. So it’s like a tour.

You might be wondering what’s so special about this. What was so interesting, was that each of our parents house is in a different sub districts. So we are planning quite a far trip. Our high school is in the main district, but we only rent room there for each of us (except one person who is actually living in the city). So when we did this trip, it’s exciting because we get to see where each other actually lived (and get a day to spend there).

We had to plan the trip carefully. Not everyone of us have motorbike. There were 5 of us, and we were using 3 bikes. We can take turn driving. We plotted where each of our houses were and planned an efficient route so we visited everyone. The first, of course my friend’s house who were living in the city (we started right after school holiday, so it’s the closest). Next, it’s my house (IIRC) because it’s the furthest. It’s also quite a challenge to reach my house via motorbike. From the district city to my house you had to use the main road (Pantura, pantai utara, or northern beach road). It’s the main logistic route. So many trucks, cars, and public transports. The road can be quite dangerous for motorbikes if you are not paying attention. You can’t drive too slow here. We are only highschool boys, so we were quite afraid that our parents don’t give us permission. I was actually prepared if they skipped my house (to avoid that road). But they insists. So my house is included in the trip and fortunately, our parents allowed us. (We all have driver licenses).

The journey in the northern beach road is quite a challenge. We took care of each other. Whenever a bus passing thru (even if it is in the opposite lane), our bike got swayed. It’s also quite windy. The wind from the open beach can sway our bike anytime without warning. After getting out from that road, we can be more relaxed. The road is a little bit bumpy (broken asphalt, etc), like a village road, but it’s safe. We got past mostly rice paddies along the way. I’m quite fond of that memories. We break a fast in my house, pray, and rests. In the morning, we went around for sightseeing around the sub district. Then we continue the journey again.

My house is in the western part of the district, and the only house in the west in our group. So after this, we go back east, but now using the southern route. It’s a less busy road. Even though my house is the only one in the west, we go there first because it’s much easier to go there before Ied Al-Fitr. Around a week before Ied Al-Fitr, the northern road will be extremely busy from the majority of Jakartans who went east for homecoming. On our way back east, we choose the southern route because clearly we can’t compete with cars if we go east along the northern road (most cars will go east around this time).

From the south, we visit each of my friend’s place, spend a night there, and continue going north, back to the district’s city. The trip is very memorable because we do lots of stupid things along the way. Sometimes we take a break and stop, just to enjoy the view. I remember a saying or proverb, 

> “You can only call a person real friend after you eat, sleep, and took a journey together.” 

So this is literally the friends we made along the way.

# I hate myself

Now you are wondering, why go from there to here? What’s all the point?

I’m not trying to make a motivational posts. It actually the other way around. I felt so demotivated, and it now resurfaces in this Ramadhan month, because throughout my life, Ramadhan was supposedly the most exciting things can happen in a year.

But things just so different now. Many things went wrong, even if it’s not about me.

Two years ago, I was excited for planning a trip to Singapore and Japan. We finally had the money to do that. We cancelled it due to covid. For some stupid reason, this country‘s pandemic management is questionable. It made me angry (and sad) on the inside. I can’t see when this is going back to normal.

I was supposed to attend an Amazon job interview in Japan. I thought, even if I didn’t land the job, at least I can go to Japan (yay). But they cancelled the trip. Then suddenly I lost all motivation for the interview. In my mind, there is very little chance for me to get accepted in this kind of situation. I‘m also sucks in the interview, tbh.

I also realized that my biggest stress reliever, playing badminton, become impossible at that time. Sure, some people still playing badminton. But, I can’t do that at that time, because morally speaking, I don’t want to become the person that I hate myself.

I also stopped doing Friday prayer. I was thinking, maybe wait until 3/4 months, so things got better, and people will organize it safely. It doesn’t get better. I even argued with my dad. He keeps doing Friday prayer, and he probably ultra sad because I didn’t. At one point my father visited my house, he went for Friday prayer. I declined, we trade banter a couple of lines, then he goes. I cried a little bit inside.

Sometimes I asked my friend, does they even think about this? The answers vary. One of my friend also stopped doing Friday prayer, even though I’m quite sure he is more religious than I am. Secretly, I feel better. But now I‘m beginning to think do I really care about Friday prayer or do I just tried to find some justification?

It got even worse. At some point, I was fed up. My work has been quite challenging at that time. Usually, I can manage because I can play some sports, like badminton. But now I can’t. In my tipping point, I decided to just play badminton in the nearby hall. I felt so refreshed, but deep inside, I knew it felt awful too. I didn’t go to Friday prayer but I played badminton? HA! What hyprocite. I feel bad. So sometimes I went Friday praying, after navigating which mosque paid attention with the protocol. But then, I thought “Damn, you only went to go praying because you want to play badminton. Hahahaha.”

Clearly it’s not healthy for me to do conflicting things. Usually I’m very vocal about saying things that I like and dislike. It’s always like this in work or social relationships. But now I hate myself.

Usually I enjoyed playing games. Lately I don’t feel that anymore. It just felt empty. I used to be very excited to spend my weekend getting all those PSN trophies until 100% achievements. But now I can’t force myself to do it. It’s just feel very useless. Even if I played it and get the trophy, then what? It still doesn’t change the real world. The government is still going to be stupid. You won’t be safe outside. All of your plan will not going to work. So what?

There’s no point. Literally no point anymore. Even if you work hard at work, there is no point. Things will not get better. You have to survive. But how? If the end goal you see is still grim.

Hmm, this feels familiar? Well yes, it’s the exact same thing with the trip years ago. The 8 hours exhausting trip. I can’t see when it’s going to end. Hell, I can’t even tell if this is halfway or not. The main difference was that, I lost all of my belief system.

Years ago, I can persevere because I believe the end goal might be worth it. Now, I don’t see any end goal that is worth it.

Years ago, I persevere because I believe I can hold my fast without drinking. Now, I don’t do Friday prayer, I played badminton, I’m a hypocrite. Because I don’t know when it will end.

It just clicked to me today. I feel dead inside because, I uncounsciously compare myself with me years ago. The me that have all the confidence to take the world. To take an arduous journey with no clear ending, completely believing that the tour itself will pay the effort. I don’t see that in me myself anymore.

Anything that I do now feels tasteless. Inadvertently, my survival instincts kicks in. My head is telling me, “None of these matters if you are dead. So, do your best to survive.” I am trying to survive, but now I keep thinking, none of this matters when you are dead.

Thus if none of these matters, why the hell are we doing this? 😅. I’m not some extraordinary person. When I’m dead, my impact to the world is miniscule. I used to hope that at some point, I can work in a super tech company, like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, etc. But it just feels near impossible if what you do day to day is not **amazing**. 

The world thru Twitter is also becomes increasingly disappointing place. I can see that my government keeps doing more and more stupid things. News about corruptions right after I paid my taxes. Government policy about covid that is not helpful. My friend, who I thought is the most vocal of adopting Sharia Economy, is buying bitcoin with questionable reasoning. Basecamp, the company that I looked up to, making a dodgy shameful company policy. Israel literally doing ethnic cleansing to Palestinians.

Why, why the world is such an ugly place?

I used to believe that Steve Jobs once said, once a person believe that they can change the world, things become different for them in their minds. However, I just can’t see anything that I did will change the world, like maybe suddenly Israel and Palestine can have peace? Huh? Is that even possible?

Or, if you remember other quote, often misattributed to Gandhi, “Be the change you wish to see in the world”. If you think about it now, it certainly not working. As we can see, some people follow Covid protocol, but it doesn’t mean everyone will follow. Some people deliberately doesn’t want to follow, for their own selfish reason (like me included, I think). So, while it’s true that you should be the change you wish to see in the world, it doesn’t necessarily means it will change the world. Also it doesn’t mean someone will be inspired by your action, especially if you don’t declare it.

I just have to accept that at some point, I have no control over what’s happening anymore. Regardless if you tried to do the “right thing”. So why bother?

# It’s alright, forgive and accept yourself

I think, unconsciously, I have a better version of myself portrayed in my brain. Some friends in the tour group that I told you about, have some trouble. Some of them can’t find job (and still single, haha). Some of them really take a bad turn in life. I don’t even know how he is doing now. Things really change drastically. Sometimes I feel like I should help them, but I don’t know why, unless they know what they really want to do.

Just with that thought, I branded myself a bad person. It maybe implicit. But it lingers. Sometimes, I wish I should be more egotistical. Like totally don’t care with the rest of the world. It seems it doesn’t work though.

When Ramadhan ends, you are supposed to celebrate. In Indonesia, we usually ask for each other’s forgiveness, in case we done something wrong in the past. This (the day to ask forgiveness) is actually not the definition of Ied Al-Fitr. This is something that happens in Indonesia only, I think. But I just realized today, that I have to be at peace with myself.

You can’t do most things by yourself. That is ok.

You (are mostly) don’t matter to the world. That is ok.

You may or may not able to make a dent in the universe. That is also ok.

You hate games now. That is ok too.

You think your work is not impactful for the company. Hmm, that is fine.

You can hate yourself, but you had to learn how to accept and forgive you, yes you. You **are** still struggling. When I did the first trip in the past, I didn’t know how it ends, or even if I like the end. But I am content with the trip itself, and the journey I experienced. I can look it back and reflect after the trip ended, not during it happened. When it happened it feels like the most exhausting things in the world. Just like now (but longer 😅).

Some of the motivational post I read also said that (from Basecamp), the company you worked for is not your family ([this post](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-company-isnt-a-family/)). I kind of agree at that time, purely because it’s more professional to think it like that. However, it is very disappointing that the same company with that kind of good vision, is also making a contradictory policy that says work channel is exclusively for work only, [not for politics](https://world.hey.com/dhh/basecamp-s-new-etiquette-regarding-societal-politics-at-work-b44bef69).

Then it suddenly falls into place in my head. If the company that I always use as a good role model can make me disappointed (even tho I don’t work there). There is also a chance that the company I was currently working on can also disappoint me like that in one way or the other. There might exists some policy that is really conflicting in my heart. If that happens, it would be very painful for me to take it personally. I would be more disappointed if that is the company that I am currently working on. But this is also not a healthy thought. If you think that your workplace is not a good environment to express yourself, you would not even be able to ”make a dent” in the company (let alone the world). To make an impact, you have to CARE first.

This brings me an analogue to the second trip. Journey of a group of friends, with some common goal, making stupid decisions along the way but still rode together until the end of the trip. I think we should think that a company is a group or pack of friends in a common journey, sharing the same goal.

In the beginning, one or more proposing the journey. One other just tag along because it seems fun. One other was persuaded. Or maybe they have different reasons. But we do it anyway. In the future, after the journey ends, we can see that some people had changed. Some took a bad turn in life. Some were unsuccessful. Some were wandering aimlessly. At the moment, I think I was the one who is wandering aimlessly. That is alright too.

In retrospect, a good idea to think of on how to handle this, is to switch perspectives into the future you. What will your future you say to you now, when you see you are struggling in this position? My future me probably think, “Meh, of course you are stuck, because [insert any reason here]. But don’t worry, I understand. It’s alright to get stuck sometimes.” Even if you don’t manage to impress someone, I think you are still going to impress yourself in the future. Just like the 8 hours trip. It’s stupid. But I’m really impressed that you are able to endure something like that.

I think I can make peace with myself now. Just like a trip, I will tag along until the final destination. Be it in work or life. I might not be able to ”make a dent” in the universe, but I can probably make the ride “enjoyable” for at least someone involved.

Until we have a different destination and part ways...
