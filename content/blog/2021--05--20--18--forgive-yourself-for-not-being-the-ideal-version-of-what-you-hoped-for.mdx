I‘m stuck with constant headache this past two days. It made me unable to sleep soundly, and doing various fun activities. I was supposed to be on holiday. I took 2 weeks paid leave, off work, during this Ied Al-Fitr, Muslim’s big holiday. I want to play games, doing some side projects, learning new things. But instead all of that, I feel so wasted. I can’t look at the screen too long, either for reading, watching movies, or playing games. But sleeping also doesn’t get me better. If I sleep, I feel like wasting too much time.

From there, I began to overthink a lot. I feel like I’m just wasting time, all over again. I reflect to all various events happening at least since this start of Ramadhan. This Covid situation made it worst. Last year, I’m still living in Bandung. I have a friendly neighbourhood. The mosque’s committee (where we can pray) can arrange good praying schedule and procedures that is compliant with ”covid protocol”. After Ied Al-Fitr, I moved away to a different city. In this city, from my perspectives, things looks grim.

\# Ramadhan in my memories

Last year, I thought this year’s Ramadhan is going to get better. It is not. I always thought that it will not bother me too much. I was wrong. It definitely affects my morale. I began comparing this year’s Ramadhan experience with what I had years ago. I know this is not good. But I can’t help it.

When I was a child, I lived about 2 or 3 km from the subdistrict Mosque. If I went there for Tarawih, I will be able to meet my friends and enjoy the rests of the night exploring the subdistrict square in front of it after praying. What makes it so special was because I’m not always able to go there. My father had to take me there (since it has to be after sun set) by motorbike. Then I had to go home with him. It’s like a special occasion. We can’t always do this because there’s also a small mosque near my house, and my father had to pray there.

There’s also an interesting story. When I was about 11 y.o, my friend invited me to see this big madrasah (like a big boarding school) called Al-Zaytun. I knew it was on a different subdistrict, so I asked him, “How do we get there?”. Because I know there’s no public transports. He said, “By bicycle of course. It’s close. I’ve done this before.” Ok, I believed him. But one thing I miscalculate was, it was currently Ramadhan month, so we were fasting.

So, with my friend, we rode our bicycle together. Thirty minutes, one hour, one hour and half past, I only drove straight, in the middle of noon. Still no big madrasah observed. I asked him,

”Damn, how many hours more we have to pedal until we get there?”

”Ah, maybe around one hour?”

Ugh, I feel so exhausted and thirsty, but we were fasting so we can’t drink. I feel like I’m going to collapse. More over, we’re just halfway there. Around 30 minutes after that, we passed the subdistrict’s border. Al-Zaytun is around the middle. There is a little joke famously known there that after passing the subdistrict border, there will be 2 different road. The left path is like a “red light district” of this sub district (you know what I mean), then the right path is the path to this religious school (Al-Zaytun). We took the right path, of course. We drove around 1 more hour. Finally we reached the gate.

”Okay, how do we get in?” I asked.

”What do you mean? you can’t get in.”

”Whaaat? You invite me to go here driving 4 hours only to stare at the gate?????”

”Well yeah…”

Ugh, now that I think back. That must be because he really wanted to study there. If we fast forward to my college years, I found that one of my college friend is from that school Al-Zaytun, so I asked if he knew about my childhood friend. Surprisingly, he went to that school. Good things for him.

But, anyway, for me, it’s the most exhausting experience I’ve ever had in elementary school. Don’t forget that I had to ride my bicycle 4 hours again to go back to my house. I spent 8 hours doing nothing but physical pain. There are no phones at that time, so I can’t contact my father and ask for help. But fortunately, with that experience, I’m confident that there’s nothing more exhausting than riding a bicycle for 8 hours (around 35 km back and forth). So, I’m quite proud with my stamina. 

Psychologically, there’s something changed in me that day. When we were halfway there, I almost gave up. I’m unbelievably thirtsy. We rests at nearby mosque. I was weighing some options. It’s too far to go back (we rode 2 hours). But if we push further, the way back is going to be more painful (I don’t know yet how long it took to get there). I’m to prideful to break my fast. I’d rather collapsed in the street than drink. So, instead of drinking, I pushed along, only believing that I can do it, for some unknown goal. I’m just hoping that the end goal will be worth it.

But it’s not.

Honestly it is not.

I arrived there with sheer willpower, but when I got there, it’s just a barren patch of lands, with big gate, and we can’t go inside. What a complete waste of time and effort.

Now think that I have to ride back home for 4 hours with that kind of feeling. In the house, I just lay there looking at the ceiling, waiting for Maghrib to come, so that I can break the fast.

Philosophically, let’s think about this. I took a journey with my friend. He convinced me that the goal is worth it (it is for him). I took the journey. I made it halfway. Halfway there, I weigh my options and I completely knew that ”I burned my bridge to go home”. So I keep going. But I was dissapointed with the goal. I went back home. The event feel completely useless, but the journey isn’t. It made me believe that I’m actually stronger than what I think. It turns out, what’s meaningful for me is the journey I made along the way, not the destination. I didn’t break a fast in that trip, even though it’s exhausting. 

It gave me confidence that sometimes in life, there will be times like this. You are doing something that is not totally worth it. But the trip teaches you something, only if you give it meaning according to what you believe in. What I believe in myself at that time is, ”I can do this without breaking a fast”. So even though the goal is disappointing, as long as you uphold your own rules, your journey is still meaningful at the end.

This trip surely changes how mindset goes when I grew up.
