# Fourier Transform Identities and Properties

We covered the basics of FT properties in [previous article of part 3](../2024--02--11--00--fourier-series-part-3/)

In this article, we are going to cover some more properties, in a more abstract way.

## Fourier Transform of a derivative

If we have function $g(t)$, and its derivative $g'(t)$. Then there is a relation between the fourier transform of $g(t)$ and $g'(t)$.

Suppose that the FT of $g(t)$ is $G(f)=\widehat{g}(f)$.

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{F}\left\{ g(t)\right\} &= \widehat{g}(f) = G(f)
\end{align*}
$$

Then the FT of the derivative $g'(t)$ with respect to $t$ is:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{F}\left\{ g'(t)\right\} &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty g'(t) \, e^{-i\tau f t} dt \\
&= \left[ g(t)\, e^{-i\tau f t} \right]_{-\infty}^\infty + i \tau f \, \int_{-\infty}^\infty g(t) \, e^{-i\tau f t} dt \\
&= 0 + i \tau f \, \widehat{g}(f) \\
&= i \tau f \, \widehat{g}(f) = i \tau f \, G(f) \\
\end{align*}
$$

From step (1) to (2), we use integration by parts.
From step (2) to (3), we rely on the assumption that if $g(t)$ is periodic, then the first term will vanish to zero.
If it is not periodic, then we are going to assume that the average also vanish to zero as $\lim_{t\to\infty}g(t) = 0$.
Finally we got result (4).

So interestingly, an FT of a derivative wrt to $t$, is the same as the FT of the original function, times $i \tau f$, with $f$ being the dual variable of $t$ (its frequency domain).

Basically FT turns derivative into a multiplication in the frequency domain.

The other interesting aspect is that you will get the same result, even if you tried to derive it using the inverse FT.

$$
\begin{align*}
g(t) &=  \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left\{ G(f) \right\} \\
&=  \int_{-\infty}^\infty G(f) \, e^{i\tau f t} df \\
\frac{d}{dt} g(t) &= \frac{d}{dt} \int_{-\infty}^\infty G(f) \, e^{i\tau f t} df \\
g'(t) &= \int_{-\infty}^\infty G(f) \, \left[ \frac{d}{dt}  e^{i\tau f t} \right] df \\
&= \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[ i \tau f G(f) \right] \,  e^{i\tau f t} \, df \\
g'(t) &= \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left\{ i \tau f G(f) \right\} \\
\mathcal{F}\left\{ g'(t) \right\} &= i \tau f G(f) \\
\end{align*}
$$

Step (1) and (2) is using the definition of inverse Fourier Transform.
Step (3) to (4) is assuming the convergence of the integrals, then by linearity, we can swap the order of integrals
and derivative, because it is against a different variable.
In step (4), we took derivative of $e^{i\tau f t}$ because it is the only term that contains variable $t$.
Step (5) is using the definition of inverse Fourier Transform, but backwards. The term in the bracket must be the Fourier Transform of $g'(t)$.

In summary, we conclude:

$$
\begin{align*}
\tag{P7}
\mathcal{F}\left\{ g(t) \right\} &= G(f) \\
\mathcal{F}\left\{ g'(t) \right\} &= i \tau f G(f) \\
\mathcal{F}\left\{ D_t^n g(t) \right\} &= (i \tau f)^n G(f) \\
\end{align*}
$$

The last row is a direct result if we took the derivative of $g(t)$, as much as $n$ times.

## Fourier Transform of a constant function

The next interesting thing to observe after figuring out derivative, is how we model a Fourier Transform of a constant function.

A constant function is tricky. It expands to both $\infty$ and $-\infty$, so the integral (area under the curve), is definitely $\infty$ as well.

In terms of periodicity, we can think of constant function as a function that has "arbitrarily small" fundamental period.
We can set it as small as possible, and it can still be considered as a periodic function, since the output is constant.

This made us wonder, suppose that there exists a smallest interval possible (but still non-zero), that can't be divided again.
Can we use this as the fundamental period $T$?

Let's challenge this idea. But first, let us use a constant $h$ to represent this smallest interval. Also, remember, it can't be zero.
