# Challenge

Here's the statement of the challenge!

<blockquote className="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
        Here&#39;s the challenge mode for all you math whizzes. Sample three numbers x, y, z uniformly at random in [0, 1], and compute (xy)^z. What distribution describes this result?
        <br />
        <br />
        Answer: It&#39;s uniform!<br /><br />I know how to prove it, but haven&#39;t yet found the &quot;aha&quot; style explanation where itâ€¦

Can we find a beautiful proof, intuitive enough to get Grant's seals of approval?
Let's attempt to do it

# What it means to sample

Let's break down the problem to smaller pieces. We need to understand what it means to sample and measure the probability distribution (let's call it PDF as Probability Density Function).

Suppose we have
