Using early return is a well known Go programming language trait.

A function must return early, as soon as possible whenever it encounters errors.
That way, there is only one possible happy path, which is by reaching the end of the function.
Thus, if you have multiple way of reaching that happy path, it is usually recommended to break 
it apart into two different function.

Consider this example snippet:

```go
func DoSequence(input Input) (result string, err error) {
	// Do A
    if input.FieldA == "nothing" {
        return "", errors.New("Error A")
    }
	// Do B
    if input.FieldB == "nothing" {
        return "", errors.New("Error B")
    }
	// Do C
    if input.FieldC == "nothing" {
        return "", errors.New("Error C")
    }
	// All done!
	return "success", nil
}
```

In the above snippet, whenever the execution reaches a failure condition (the if statement for each Do A, Do B, etc),
it returns early by sending the error message. So the end result, is only accessible if we passed all these early returns.
As you can see, this gets very verbose quickly. But people like them because the execution order is flat and linear.

However, things get really messy when the sequence is not linear or it contains several branches before converging 
into the happy path. Whenever it happens, it is encouraged to break apart the flow into separate function. 
That way, you set cognitive boundary by requiring the reader to understand one function as just one flat flow.

In some cases, creating a function complicates things because you need to pass the context and variables of the 
parent function into this child function. If the function also only used once, it adds little benefit since you 
increase the callstack, but it is unnecessary because only one parent executes that function. To add to the confusion,
when you are reading a package with many-many non-flat private function, it is not clear at which level those 
private function is called. This made your code prone to refactor as well if the parent context changes and you need 
to pass more variables to these functions. Basically, it is harder to review without actually jumping into the code.

In the above example, consider a case where you need to do 3 things in `Do A`:

1. For some errors, you return early (like usual)
2. For a successful `Do A` with some condition, you return early with succesful result
3. For a failed `Do A` with fallthru/fallback condition, you need to proceed into `Do C`

Semantically, if `DoA` is a function, you would create the function in such a way that point 3, is the happy path of the function.
That way, it is seen last in the code body. But, it is confusing because point 3 actually means that **you failed to execute `DoA`**,
so you need to fallback to execute another function, which is `DoC`. A better way to read `DoA` is to put point 2 as the last return, 
just like how Go function uses early return. We now realize that a semantic structure in `DoA` doesn't necessarily means 
the same semantic structure makes sense for the parent `DoSequence`. Now add some nested ifs and functions, you suddenly have a spaghetti 
code that is easy to write but hard to read. Especially if this is a business logic full of criterias/branch flows.

In language like python, it is easily solved because they have `try except finally` control flow.
You could wrap all of them in one `try` block, then let `Do A` block raise appropriate error if it needs to return early by throwing error.
If it needs to return early with succesful result, just return as usual.
Then if it needs to fallback to `Do C`, just put `Do C` in a `finally` block, and then let `Do A` block raise a handled error in `except` block.

In Go this is not possible, so here's my preferred fun alternative.

By using a `for` block, you have the abilities to `break` out of the block, while still being in the same function.
This is a much conscise block rather than anonymous functions (which I actually prefer if the whole thing is functional),
`switch` block (too verbose if the first condition has only one case), 
`defer` block (you should not use this for control flow), or `goto` statement (can be a nightmare to manage).

Here's how it looks like for these kind of cases:

```go
func DoSequence(input Input) (result string, err error) {
	// Do A
	for range [1]bool{} {
		if input.FieldA == "nothing" {
			return "", errors.New("Error A")
		}
		if input.FieldA == "something" {
			// we want to fallback by continuing to Do B and Do C
			break
		}

		// do some A stuff Here
		resultA, err := mypackage.CallA(input)

		// succesful result that needs early return
		if resultA == "success" {
			return resultA, nil
		}

		// other resultA that needs fallback to Do B and Do C
		// will naturally exits this block
	}
	// Do B
	if input.FieldB == "nothing" {
		return "", errors.New("Error B")
	}
	// Do C
	if input.FieldC == "nothing" {
		return "", errors.New("Error C")
	}
	// All done!
	return "success", nil
}
```

The `for` block, basically executes only once by using `range [1]bool{}` statement to iterate a slice with one element.
You could also use a more straightforward `for i:=0; i==0; i++`, but for me it is another case of "it is easier to write it than read it" thing.
The `range` statement is easier to read and understand at a glance.

As a remark note, if we have multiple pre-condition to check for the execution to enter `// Do A` block.
Then just use `switch`. That's what it is used for.

```go
func DoSequence(input Input) (result string, err error) {
	// Do A
	switch {
    case <condition-1>, <condition-2>, <condition-3>:
		if input.FieldA == "nothing" {
			return "", errors.New("Error A")
		}
		if input.FieldA == "something" {
			// we want to fallback by continuing to Do B and Do C
			break
		}

		// do some A stuff Here
		resultA, err := mypackage.CallA(input)

		// succesful result that needs early return
		if resultA == "success" {
			return resultA, nil
		}

		// other resultA that needs fallback to Do B and Do C
		// will naturally exits this block
	}
	// Do B
	if input.FieldB == "nothing" {
		return "", errors.New("Error B")
	}
	// Do C
	if input.FieldC == "nothing" {
		return "", errors.New("Error C")
	}
	// All done!
	return "success", nil
}
```

If you didn't fancy `for` range that I told you before, then this is an alternatives:

```go
func DoSequence(input Input) (result string, err error) {
	// Do A
	switch {
    case true:
		if input.FieldA == "nothing" {
			return "", errors.New("Error A")
		}
		if input.FieldA == "something" {
			// we want to fallback by continuing to Do B and Do C
			break
		}

		// do some A stuff Here
		resultA, err := mypackage.CallA(input)

		// succesful result that needs early return
		if resultA == "success" {
			return resultA, nil
		}

		// other resultA that needs fallback to Do B and Do C
		// will naturally exits this block
	}
	// Do B
	if input.FieldB == "nothing" {
		return "", errors.New("Error B")
	}
	// Do C
	if input.FieldC == "nothing" {
		return "", errors.New("Error C")
	}
	// All done!
	return "success", nil
}
```

Frankly, I wish people just use `switch` more. But most programmers (probably?) has been hardwired to think that 
`switch` is used as a kind of map or pattern match rather than statement blocks. 
So perhaps "for once" semantic is more acceptable for them.

What do you think? `For once` or `switch true`?
