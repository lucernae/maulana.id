The following blog post is just an attempt to sort my thought regarding Heisenber's Uncertainty Principle
and its more fundamental relation to Fourier Uncertainty Principle.

# Definition

[Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform#Uncertainty_principle)

For the mathematical and more generic expressions of this uncertainty principle, we refer to a function
$f(x)$. It's fourier transform is $\hat{f}(\xi)$. With $\sigma$ as the variance operator, then

$$
\sigma^2_f \sigma^2_{\hat{f}} \geq \frac{1}{16\pi^2}
$$

For Heisenberg Uncertainty principle, it was known that momentum $p$ and position $x$ is a conjugate pair.
The form then takes:

$$
\sigma_x \sigma_p \geq \frac{h}{4\pi}
$$

## Fourier Uncertainty Principle

I think it was called Fourier uncertainty principle because it is basically rises because of Fourier transform.
However, personally I would like to think that it was apparent due to an orthogonality of the observables.

### Foundation from Euclidean Geometry and Pythagorean Theorem

Suppose we are using Euclidean Geometry, so [Pythagorean Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) is applicable

$$
r^2 = x^2 + y^2
$$

In this case, $x$ and $y$ are orthogonal (due to right triangle).

We then have [triangle inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality)

$$
x + y \geq r
$$

We then introduce something called "norm", which we can thought of as length. The symbol is $\|x\|$ for norm of $x$.
Triangle inequality can then be re-expressed as these, in order to make sure that we are talking about length, and not coordinates.

$$
\|x\| + \|y\| \geq \|r\|
$$

If we re-express this inequality, we can also say that there are separation coefficient (next we will call it angle)
that will determine "length" of these products. Later we will call these products as "inner product" or dot product.

For above triangle $\|x\|$ or $\|y\|$ is always less or equal than $\|r\|$. We can introduce this separation coefficient as angle $\theta$.
Also $\cos{\theta}$ measures how far it is from the bigger length.

That means using above triangle, we can express.

$$
\|r\| \cos{\theta_{rx}} = \|x\| \\[8pt]
\|y\| \|r\| \cos{\theta} = \|x\| \|y\| \\[8pt]
$$

Since the coefficient (the $\cos{\theta}$ function) is always less than 1, it was guaranteed that:

$$
\|y\| \|r\| > \|x\| \|y\| \\[8pt]
\|r\| \|r\| > \|x\| \|y\| \\[8pt]
\|r\|^2 > \|x\| \|y\| \\[8pt]
$$

This illustrate the ideas of the relationship between each sides of the right triangle and its hypothenuse.
Meaning, the square of the hypothenuse bounded the product of length between the other two sides.

We can generalize the ideas further by just expressing the inequality by using only two sides, and for any triangle.

If we express $x$ and $y$ as vectors $\bf{x}$ and $\bf{y}$, any two vectors can be made triangle.
Any triangle can then be decomposed as two right triangles. Then, with any right triangle we can use the "angle" separation to derive the inequalities.

In short, we can declare/generalize/deduce something like this:

$$
|\langle \mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} \rangle |\leq \|\mathbf {x} \|\|\mathbf {y} \|
$$

With term $\langle \mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} \rangle$ means the inner product between $\mathbf {x}$ and $\mathbf {y}$.

The inequality above is called [Cauchy–Schwarz inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy–Schwarz_inequality)

In my understanding, inner product just really means that you can multiply 2 objects while making sure that the product will not exceed certain limit.
In this case, the limit is the separation angle between two vectors, which can be defined like this.

$$
\cos{\theta_{xy}} = \frac{|\langle \mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} \rangle |}{\|\mathbf {x} \|\|\mathbf {y} \|}
$$

From Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we can proof that it is a more general form of triangle inequality and can be used to derive it

### Deriving Triangle inequality using Cauchy–Schwarz inequality

Express the triangle as vectors and you got $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{x} +\mathbf{y}$.
So,

$$
{\displaystyle
{\begin{alignedat}{4}
    \|\mathbf {x} +\mathbf {y} \|^{2} &= \langle \mathbf {x} +\mathbf {y} ,\mathbf {x} +\mathbf {y} \rangle &&
        \\ &= \|\mathbf {x} \|^{2}+\langle \mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} \rangle +\langle \mathbf {y} ,\mathbf {x} \rangle +\|\mathbf {y} \|^{2} ~&&~ {\text{ where }} \langle \mathbf {y} ,\mathbf {x} \rangle ={\overline {\langle \mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} \rangle }}
        \\ &= \|\mathbf {x} \|^{2}+2\operatorname {Re} \langle \mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} \rangle +\|\mathbf {y} \|^{2} &&
        \\ &\leq \|\mathbf {x} \|^{2}+2|\langle \mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} \rangle |+\|\mathbf {y} \|^{2}&&\\&\leq \|\mathbf {x} \|^{2}+2\|\mathbf {x} \|\|\mathbf {y} \|+\|\mathbf {y} \|^{2}~&&~{\text{ using Cauchy-Schwarz}}
        \\ &=(\|\mathbf {x} \|+\|\mathbf {y} \|)^{2} &&
\end{alignedat}}
} \\[8pt]

{\displaystyle
{\begin{alignedat}{4}
    \|\mathbf {r}\|^{2} &\leq (\|\mathbf {x} \|+\|\mathbf {y} \|)^{2} &&
    \\ \|\mathbf {r} \| &\leq \|\mathbf {x} \|+\|\mathbf {y} \| &&
\end{alignedat}}
} \\[8pt]
$$

In the notation above ${\overline {\langle \mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {y} \rangle }}$, the overline is called a conjugate sign.
It changed the vector into its conjugate.

The operator $\operatorname{Re}$ is a special bilinear function, generalized from complex space to real spaces.
If you represent the vectors as complex numbers, you can think of the operator as a function that only take the real part of the complex number.

### Complex space and numbers operations

We generalize the ideas of vectors and complex numbers to have some rules on how to operate on complex numbers and its identities.

Any triangle then can be represented by using two complex numbers. This is because two complex numbers will have two length (norm),
one notion of separation called "angle" between two of them. The remaining triangle side is taken from the operation of complex numbers,
which can be addition or multiplication, depending on the context.

It is more convenient to work with complex numbers because it can be prooved the other way around.
When you work with complex numbers, then it is equivalent to some operations in vector spaces as well.
So complex numbers, in a sense, is more "complete", because you have lots of operation possible.

I'm just going to assume we understand complex numbers by attaching this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number)

### Fourier transform

We previously work with numbers. But when we define a function, we can work with a set of numbers all at once.
Then, there is "function transform", which is a way to manipulate a function to another function with a specific transform rules.

If I where to make an analogy, think of numbers as balls. We can pick and move one ball.
If we want to move many many balls, we need a container. A function can be thought of as this container where we put our balls, before we move it.
We can just move the container to move all the balls. Lastly, a function transform can be thought of the shape of container.
If we want to move the balls from one place to the other, it is easier to use box container.
But, some operations are easier to do using different container shape. For example to roll all these balls
all at once, it is easier to use a sphere container instead of boxes.

[Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) is "function transform" with very specific rules. This transform applies for function that maps complex numbers to complex numbers.
Since real numbers is a subset of complex numbers, then Fourier transform can be applied to real function as well.

There are several definition to choose from, they are all equivalent, the difference is just wether the function becomes normalized or not.
By "**norm**alized", I mean it can have norms but the maximum length the norm can have is 1.

$$
{\displaystyle {\hat {f}}(\xi )=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }f(x)\ e^{-i2\pi \xi x}\,dx.}
$$

What the transform is doing, is map **all** numbers in the set of complex numbers $x$ into an entirely
different set of complex numbers $\xi$. We have a change of variables by applying the transform, which is
a product of the function value with a complex rotation $e^{-i2\pi \xi}$, in which the value $\xi$ is the target map of the result of the integral over all $x$.

So we get an entirely different function called "f-hat" $\hat{f}(\xi)$, in which it uses this "xi" $\xi$ as the parameter.

Now, since $\hat{f}(\xi)$ is also a complex function, we can do another Fourier transform. In fact we can do it in the reverse rotation direction, by
multiplying it with $e^{i2\pi x}$ and we will get the original function.

$$
{\displaystyle f(x)=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }{\hat {f}}(\xi )\ e^{i2\pi \xi x}\,d\xi }
$$

There are several proof and identities helping this Fourier transform definition.
The insights that we have using these rules is that:

- A function $f$ and its Fourier transform $\hat{f}$ is basically the same thing but in a different form and domain.
- Any operation that you do to an $\hat{f}$ has a corresponding operation in $f$
- Any operation that you do to $\hat{f}$ will have the operation be appliead as well to $f$, and you can recover
  the applied operation by inverting the Fourier transform
- Some operation is easier to do as $\hat{f}$ and some in $f$
- Identities or rules in $\hat{f}$ means it also applies to $f$, even though it seems to be counter intuitive or bizarre.
  This is entirely due to the mathematical relation between Fourier tranform and its inverse.

### Deriving uncertainty principle

Start with a function that maps from complex to complex called $f(z)$

Fourier transform of $f(z)$ is $\hat{f}(\xi)$.

Let the function $f$ be "square-integrable" then $\hat{f}$ be "square-integrable" as well due to fourier transform

Using [Parseval-Plancherel identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plancherel_theorem), we know:

$$
{\displaystyle \int _{-\infty }^{\infty }|f(z)|^{2}\,dz=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }|{\widehat {f}}(\xi )|^{2}\,d\xi }
$$

This will then imply/hinting that Pythagorean theorem in general works in this space.

Since it was proven to be correct, then there is a corresponding triangle with orthonormal basis in that space.
The space is also equivalent with Euclidean geometry.

Within triangles in Euclidean geometry, it was hinted that there exists Triangle inequality.

The triangle inequality relationship that we can use is [Cauchy–Schwarz Inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy–Schwarz_inequality).

Now we define the space or plane to put our triangle in. An interesting intuition is the question:

"Since a function and its Fourier transform essentially refer to the same **thing** but using different perspectives. What happens if we apply Cauchy-Scharwz Inequality to function and its own Fourier transform?"

Intuitively we can guess that the results is somewhat fundamental and a characteristic of the function itself.
It will entirely defined by the "function" itself, and not by its domain or units.
In other words, it was invariant of units or domain.

To proceed, recall that a function maps to a unique Fourier transform, and the other way around as well.
It is possible to imagine or visualize how a function maps to another function, but I'm having trouble explaining it with drawings.

However if we inspect further, what we are actually trying to manipulate is the $L_2$ norm. This is an absolute positive values without imaginary part.
If we also only cares about the modulus $|z|$ and $|\xi|$, then we can reduce the number of axis we want to map from 8 to 4.

The triangle then can be placed in the two plane.
One plane that plots a graph of $(|z|,|f(z)|)$.
One plane that plots a graph of $(|\xi|,|\hat{f}(x)|)$.
It will span a range of values possible values for both $f$ and $\hat{f}$.

Square integrability ensure that the area under the curve is finite for both graph.

Pancherel-Parseval identity make sure that the area from both graph has to be the same.

However, range of possible values for $|f|$ and $|\hat{f}|$ has to be reciprocal or inverted, because Fourier transform can be inverted.
Same argument applies for the range of $|z|$ and $|\xi|$.

We can now intuitively understands where the triangle is.
Since $f$ and $\hat{f}$ is unique mapping, referring to one of them is enough by just describing the range.
Since the curve itself won't change under domain translations, then it is easier for us to first define the "mean" or "center point" for
each $f$ and $\hat{f}$. Let's just say it was centered at $z_0$ and $\xi_0$.

Now consider arbitrary triangle in $f$. The base of the triangle is the length from $z$ to $z_0$, which is $|z-z_0|$.
At $z_0$, it will have vertical height of $|f(z_0)|$, which is the average value of $f$. You can then draw a straight line from $z$ to $|f(z)|$, lets call it $|r|$ and form a right triangle.
Notice that at any point $z$, we can draw a triangle. If we multiply the sides that are not $r$, it will satisfy Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.
