# Why I use GatsbyJS

This site were previously built using GatsbyJS framework. The reason why I used GatsbyJS:

1. Support for [MDX JS](https://mdxjs.com) which is an extension of Markdown syntax with JSX component support

By using MDX, I can inject my markdown content with interactivity component made possible using JSX, while also making sure that my MDX file is **framework agnostic**.
By framework agnostic, I mean the content is semantically readable and have the same meaning, suppose that it was read in Raw, rather than rendered using any framework.

2. Static site generators

Means I can use free or cheap hosting servers, because I essentially served static files without any server side process.
I can deploy using various vendor-agnostic approach. It can be to Netlify, NextJS, Github Pages, or can even self serve using my own VPS.

3. Decoupling the content with the technology to serve it

GatsbyJS has an excellent vision of entirely separating the content with the CMS or the engine itself.
This way, I can build/improve the engine independently with the content.
I don't have to rely on existing engine like Wordpress, or CMS web framework like Joomla or Django.

Based on above 3 key principles, at that time it was only GatsbyJS that ticks all boxes.
Frankly, I want to spend my entire time writing more content, rather than making fancy blog engine.
So I want to reduce time learning all these JS framework that often changes very often.

# Why it's not feasible for me to use GatsbyJS anymore

Throughout using GatsbyJS, I stumbled upon problems:

1. JS ecosystem is not the most stable ecosystem

Things very often changes, and it was very flaky. I hate it when you want to write content weekly and suddenly every other week
your build in Netlify just suddenly doesn't work anymore. Eventually I have to bring my own solution to keep the entire thing buildable and stable:

- I used Nix to pin the crucial dependencies such as Node JS version and whatever native dependencies Node needed
- I used dependabot and renovate bot to keep my CI/CD pipeline always tested with the latest applicable npm packages listed in the `package.json`
- I used Nix to setup CI/CD so I can test major version upgrade of packages on separate branches. If it is not easy to fix, I abandoned it and won't upgrade

2. Core GatsbyJS plugins has become a mess and less improved

When I have issues, I check if the next version fix the issues. But I feel overwhelmed with how crazy the JS ecosystem is for casual user!
In the past, I upgraded Katex package or remark packages, and suddenly things don't work because some import that uses `require` now must use ESM `import` statements.
Not too mention I also need to know whether the package were made for client side rendering (in the browser) or server side (run via Node JS).
This is insanely difficult to track.

At some point, I rely on Nix again to keep things stable on the version that was guaranteed to work. It was a pain to migrate from Gatsby 3 to Gatsby 5.
I'm not even sure if I can migrate iteratively to v5 without using Nix.

3. Build and Development mode has become increasingly slow

As my content grew, it becomes increasingly painful to run dev mode and see my local changes, because Gatsby will need to recompile everything.
My biggest bottleneck is because I have many static images for my blogs, and Gatsby source systems requires these static assets to run against its "image sharp" tools
which basically optimizes image loading time. It is a good feature on prod mode, but useless on dev mode because at most I will only edit one article at a time.
So I don't need all my images to be rebuilt. But there is no option to toggle it off!

4. Adding my latest component break the build completely

This is the last straw. When I tried to integrate [MUI X Charts](https://mui.com/x/react-charts/), even dev mode failed to build.
It just stopped without any recommendation on what to fix.
The error were just the process received **SIGSEGV**, which can be from anything.
This is after I increased node virtual memory to 4GB. Which is ridiculous since it still not being able to build it.

Reason 1 to 3 is somewhat manageable, because we can have workaround using Nix.

Reason 4, is just dead end. Because I can't build and run dev mode at all. Which is why I need to change my blog engine.

# Why I choose Astro

I choose [Astro](https://astro.build) for the following simple reason:

1. It must be able to compile MDX, and can use React/JSX to inject interactive component
2. It must be able to integrate with $KaTeX$, since I wrote math equation in my blog
3. It should be still be able to build as static sites
4. The new engine must be able to handle the same routing, so that my existing blogs doesn't change content URLs
5. Must be vendor-agnostic

Frankly speaking, requirement 1 excludes most options like Hugo or other engines using other programming languages.
It needs to be using JS. In the future, if I can transpile Python or Go to JSX, perhaps there could be more choices.

I also knew about Astro from Gatsby reddit community. Most redditor mentioned that Gatsby are dead now, and we should move to Astro.

After checking out Astro a little bit, I identified several key challenges:

1. In a conceptual level, Astro and Gatsby is really different

Gatsby uses webpack to transpile all the content into SPA. Astro uses vite to target only serving static HTML + CSS components, but not Javascript.
This caused all my custom functionality I have been built in Gatsby unusable out of the box, because it requires client side JS.

2. Astro file has its own syntax

I get the idea that Astro uses its own syntax to segregate its `*.astro` files to be transpiled differently.
This is useful so that they don't associate Astro's key ideas as JSX, because the rendering method is different.

However, frankly I don't want to commit on using other separate syntax for my contents. So I will keep using MDX, but probably
made several Astro files as a glue. I will treat this Astro files as expendable in case I have to migrate to other stacks.

3. Astro islands requires different handling

Some key principles of Astro like Astro islands requires me to modify my existing MDX content. Even though I had hoped those files
will stay the same, even if the engine changes.

For client side activity, the component I refer to in markdown needs to have special `client:only="react"` attribute in it.

Although all those 3 challenges were solvable. It turns out I need to spent more time than I estimate to completely solved it.
